            Counter Strike
        </h1>
        <p>This is a super cool video game called Counter Strike. I like to play it on the
            weekends when i don't have to do work. In Counter Strike, you shoot other people in the head
            to win. It's also super competetive, so if you play bad, your teamates will probably find your
            address.

        Right now, people are very excited for the new installment to come out, Counter Strike 2.
        It is finally releasing soon after over a decade of waiting!
